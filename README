This program is a simple wordcount-style utility that generates statistics
about a file provided. The output is given in the format:

words: <number of words, where "words" are space-separated>
lines: <number of lines>
average letters per word: <average number of letters (upper or lower case ASCII) per word>
most common letter: <most commonly occuring letter (upper or lower case ASCII), given as lower case equivalent>

NOTES:
* The latter two statistics analyse letters, not raw characters, i.e. in the string "Foo.Bar.Bar", 
  the "most common" letters are [o, a, r], not the character '.'

* Most common letter is calculated by viewing 'A' and 'a' as equivalent.

BUILDING:
* The simplest way to build is to run "ant build".

TESTING:
* Tests can be run by calling "ant test".

RUNNING:
* On a *nix system, the simplest way to run is to call the included bash script, using:
          ./mywc.sh <filepath>
  This will build the project if necessary and run the utility.

* Alternatively the jar file "MyWC.jar" can be run using:
          java -jar MyWC.jar <filepath>
